Hello, World! My name is Joseph Bales and welcome to my new website. This is where I'll be putting all my development focused content and other technology related writings. It will be a one stop shop for my "developing" career as a software developer <small>(I see what you did there)</small>.

I plan to focus mainly on web development and the lessons I learn each day as a developer in the enterprise space. Content will be focused around .NET, C#, JavaScript, SQL, Devops, and other things I might learn along the way. Thanks for your interest in my career.
